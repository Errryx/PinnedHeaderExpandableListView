Usage
==============================

Init view with:

         PHExpandableListView phExpandableListView = new PHExpandableListView(this);
         phExpandableListView.setExpandableListView(expandableListView);

make sure set tag for groupView, like in your adapter:

         @Override
         public View getGroupView(int groupPosition, boolean isExpanded, View convertView, ViewGroup parent) {
          // setup the group view and the tag
          convertView.setTag(groupPosition);
         }

And that's it.

TODO
=======
Using view tag to retrieve group views is not really a good implementation, but I didn't come up with other ideas now.
